# geeetech-3d-touch
stuck in trigger loop
i am running audrono 1.1.7. with a gt2560 A+ board with a geetech 3d touch.  i have had this printer running for several hours until i got a bltouch error m999. i have tried evertything. this morning i got the trigger to clear on z after several m280 codes. when i started to print the error came right back.
